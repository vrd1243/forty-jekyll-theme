I am a second year PhD student studying computer science at CU Boulder. I'm working with <a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/">Prof. Liz Bradley</a>, and my primary research interests are time series analysis and forecasting. 
I have also recently started dabbling in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 

I live in <a href="/about/golden.jpeg">Golden, Colorado</a>. I am an <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29825333-varad-deshmukh">avid reader</a>, love <a href="/about/flagstaff.jpeg">road biking</a>, and often head out to my backyard for a <a href="/about/southtable.jpeg">good climb</a>. 
When I feel frustrated at not doing enough math, I have a go at some excellent books, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics">so</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming">so</a>.

When I am not doing either of those things, I indulge in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Strange">computer gaming</a>.

I am on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varad-deshmukh-b5367823/">LinkedIn</a>,
    and some of my project codes are on <a href="https://github.com/vrd1243">GitHub</a>. <br>
